# CS-320 Software Test Automation QA
A repository for my work completed throughout my CS-320 Software Test, Automation QA course at Southern New Hampshire University. Through these projects, I have honed my skills in writing functional, secure code, interpreting user needs, and designing robust software solutions.

# Reflections

# Ensuring Functional & Secure Code
Throughout all of my projects, I have placed a strong emphasis on making sure my code is secure and functional. I thoroughly test my code using unit tests and edge-case scenarios to ensure functionality. This makes it easier to confirm that the program operates exactly as intended in a variety of scenarios. I follow best practices for security, which include protecting sensitive data, enforcing the practice of encapsulation, and validating user input. To ensure a robust codebase, I also perform code reviews and employ tools to find possible vulnerabilities.

# Interpreting User Needs
A key component of creating software that has significance is comprehending the needs of its users. To make sure I have a clear idea of what the end user expects, I begin by obtaining requirements through user stories or direct feedback. I make sure the application is in line with the user's objectives by prioritizing features and dividing them into achievable tasks. Iterative development methods and frequent stakeholder check-ins enable me to take input into account and modify the program as needs change.

# Approaching Software Design
I start my software design process with a solid basis in architecture and planning. I concentrate on using design concepts like SOLID and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) to write modular, maintainable code. I can see the structure of the software before it is implemented with the use of tools like wireframes, pseudocode, and flowcharts. My goal is to strike a balance between scalability and simplicity so that the program may expand to meet user demands while still being simple to maintain.
